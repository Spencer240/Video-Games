# Video-Games
A repository of a number of small scale video games I coded in my free time.

These video games are a personal project of mine to keep me entertained, otherwise I would get bored. I was inspired to make this after coding a game for my AP Computer Science Principles class. The create task obviously will never be published in this repository, but I wanted to do more on a public-ish scale. For now, these games are free to download from this github only and I might set up a patreon in the future to continue to fund this small hobby.
